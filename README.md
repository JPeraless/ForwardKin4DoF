# Kinematics for a 4 DoF manipulator

Inaccurate_Sketch contains forward and inverse kinematics programs, and a .txt file with all the relevant info, for an inaccurate kinematic diagram of the manipulator.

Following the same principles and strategies used for Inaccurate_Sketch: 
    - forwardKin.py contains the forward kinematics script for the real manipulator.

    - inverseKin.py contains the inverse kinematics script for the real manipulator.

    - manipulatorMatrices.txt contains all the relevant revolute and homogenous matrices, as well as the displacement vectors for the real manipulator.
